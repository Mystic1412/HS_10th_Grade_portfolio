    <h1>Web Design 9/22/20</h1>
 <h2>Lab 1 Nichole Lin</h2>
 <p1>Hello, my name is Nichole Lin. I'm a current 10th grader taking a web design class, and AP computer science principle class, at Thomas Edison High School. I'm taking this class to gain a new skill, and more knowlegde about coding. Web design can also help me in knowing about how coding and software works and I can go off and learn other programming language on my own. In the future I want to work in some with coding like game design, computer science, or software developer. For now, I'm looking forward to making my own website even if I don't know much about coding.</p1>
