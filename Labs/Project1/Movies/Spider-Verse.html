    <h3 class="BottomSubHeading">Summary</h3>
    <p class="BottomInfo">Mile Morales was a regular teenage boy from Brooklyn until he was bitten by a radioactive spider, which gave him the same abilities and powers as Spider-Man. With his newly discovered powers he has to become the new Spider-Man in his dimension after the previous Spider-Man died. He soon discovers there are other Spider-Man from other dimensions, and he has to help them get back to their dimension, while trying to figure out his own new powers. Ultimately, Spider-verse is an awesome movie, every sense looks amazing, and you can see all the hard work that was put into this movie.</p>

    <h3 class="BottomSubHeading">Personal Review</h3>
    <p class="BottomInfo">I love Spider-verse because every frame of the movie is drawn in and you can pause the movie at any time to see the art/frame of the scene. Also this movie has an amazing soundtrack, that I have listened to over and over again and haven't gotten over it. In addition, Spider-verse, the movie is made to look and feel like a comic book, and it does exactly that.</p>
