    <h3 class="BottomSubHeading">Summary</h3>
    <p class="BottomInfo">Wall-E is the last robot on Earth, his job is to tidy up the Earth while the humans are gone. Wall-E has developed a personality during the 700 years he has been tidying up the Earth, and he feels really lonely. Then he met Eve, who is on a mission to find a living self-sustaining plant life on earth. Wall-E and Eve soon go on an adventure together all across the galaxy. Overall, Wall-E is a great movie to watch with family, friends, or just alone, since it will give you so much emotions no matter what.</p>

    <h3 class="BottomSubHeading">Personal Review</h3>
    <p class="BottomInfo">I love Wall-E because even though the Wall-E and Eve don’t have that much dialog, they still provide a lot of emotions. Also I love that it’s a movie about how two robots fall in love, even though robots are not supposed to have emotions, or personalities.</p>
